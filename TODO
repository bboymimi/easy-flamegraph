The next step will need to implement order/migrate-type/size based
flamegraph to visualize the result easily. Also, other report can be

1). The 5s memory-related data comparison(vmstat/meminfo/zoneinfo).
2). The memory allocation comparison during the 5s with each process
and what type of memory it allocates.
